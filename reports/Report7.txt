This assignment has four files. First the futures.h contains declaration of all the variables and functions and this file is in include directory. Second file is futures.c which contains the definition of four major functions needed to implement the futures. This file is located i0n system directory. Futures can be implemented in three mode. In first mode, which is the exclusive mode one consumer and producer thread at a time can use the future variable. When one thread is calling future_set another thread will fail when calls future_set. Similar explanation goes for multiple thread calling future_get at the same time. In Shared mode, multiple thread can call the future_get function and they will wait in the queue until some thread calls future_set. When one thread calls future_set all the thread waiting in the queue gets freed and gets the value set by the thread that called future_set. But two thread cannot call future_set at same time. If one thread is waiting in the set_queue and another thread calls future_set then a SYSERR will be returned to that thread. In Queue mode, multiple thread can call future_get and future_set. The threads calling future_get gets queued in get_queue and threads calling future_set will get queued in set_queue. The thread calling future_set releases the first thread in get_queue and thread calling future_get releases first thread in set_queue. future_alloc creates a new pointer to future_t using getmem and creates new memory for both get_queue and set_queue. future_free uses freemem to release all memory. First each releases each node of set_queue and get_queue and then it finally releases future_t pointer.
